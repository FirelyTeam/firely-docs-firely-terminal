Login with Firely Terminal into Simplifier
------------------------------------------

Several api endpoints in Simplifier require you to login first. By
logging in, Firely Terminal gives you access to most of these endpoints:

-  packages api
-  zip upload and download api
-  fhir endpoint
-  writing (post and put) to private fhir endpoinds

In order to login with Firely Terminal use the ``login`` command:

.. code-block:: Bash

     > fhir login

After this you must provide your credentials: email address and
password. Login uses standard JWT practices so that your credentials are
sent safely over the wire only once and so that sequentual requests are
done with a token, so that your credentials donâ€™t have to be stored
locally either.
