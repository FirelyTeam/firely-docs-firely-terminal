Firely Terminal (formerly known as Torinox) is a cross platform FHIR command line tool that helps you working with files containing FHIR resources.

We are currently migrating the documentation here. Until that is complete you can find the `documentation for Firely Terminal on Simplifier.net <https://simplifier.net/docs/firelyterminal>`_.
