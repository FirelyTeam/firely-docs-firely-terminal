Quality Control 
================
From Firely Terminal v2.1 our Quality Control feature is available in our versatile command line tool. 

With the command ``fhir check`` you can run the `minimal ruleset <https://docs.fire.ly/projects/Simplifier/develop/quality-control/structure.html#minimal-ruleset>`

If you want to run a different set of Quality Control rules you can simply add that to the command. For example if you want to run the, by Firely recommended, rule set you use ``fhir check recommended``. 

*Note* Qualtity control rules are stored in a <name>.rules.yaml file extension. To run the rules in Firely Terminal you only have to add the <name> to the command.
